# Control | [Speed Control of a DC Motor](Control_Guide.pdf)

>The goal of this laboratory is to model, identify, and develop a feedback controller to control the speed of DC motor with a load gear. The following topics will be covered:
>
>- Experimentally identify and validate the parameters of the model based on the step response and
>frequency response of the system.
>- Design a speed controller to meet a given set of specifications using loop-shaping techniques.
>- Test the designed controller in simulation and ensure that the specifications are satisfied.
>- Implement the controller on the real device and evaluate the performance.
